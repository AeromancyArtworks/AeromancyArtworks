- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AeromancyArtworks.  My name is Philip Giannattasio.  I started meditating 3 years ago.  Before long, I was drawn to the Sky in a way I cannot describe.  I started seeing things in the Clouds and everyone I showed picrures to couldn't see what I was seeing.  So I set out to find a way to show the world exactly what it is that I could see. Now I showcase my work as NFTs.
